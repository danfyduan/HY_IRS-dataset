The dataset used in this study consists of continuous observed thermal infrared images in a physical test for the cooling water discharged from a coastal power plant. The power plant uses seawater as its cooling source, drawn from a nearby sea channel on the southeast side of the plant and discharged through another channel on the west side.
HY_IRS dataset: Includes 10736 thermal infrared images of cooling water discharge under different experiment conditions. These images were converted into grayscale images with a resolution of 320Ã—240 and randomly divided into a training set (8500 images), a validation set (1236 images), and a test set (500 images).
